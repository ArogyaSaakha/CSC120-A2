What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I could not get my program to work due to a bug. I feel like I was able to convert the given code to its object oriented way but errors occured. I could not figure out why I had a positional arguement for price. Though I learnt a lot about python through this assignment, I also require myself to put in a lot for effort for me to understand and execute the code better.
